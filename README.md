# QuizMe
QuizMe is a simple quiz program, inspired by Quizlet, that is customizable by the user to quiz them using flashcards.

## Description
Welcome to QuizMe! This is a small project, written in Python, that I'm turning in for my AP Computer Science Principles test. QuizMe intakes definitions and vocab terms from the user, and then quizzes them on those terms through the command line in a flashcard style, where the user can decide if they want to answer with terms, or definitions. It's user friendly and quite straightforward.

## Setup
QuizMe is quite easy to setup.  

1. To start off, simply download the full program. No need to worry about dependencies or libraries that need to be installed, as the program runs exclusively off standard python modules.

2. To give the program the definitions and vocab terms, navigate to the 'DOCUMENTS' folder within the project. You will see two files, 'definitions.txt' and 'vocab.txt'. On each new line of these files, include a term/definition. For example, 'Apple' would go on line 1 in 'vocab.txt' and 'A red fruit' would go on line 1 of 'definitions.txt', the next term and definition would go on line 2 of their corresponding files, and so on. Make sure you input the correct terms and definitions on their corresponding lines! If the files are a different length, the program will let you know, and you'll have to fix it and restart.

## Start

Once you've inputted all of the terms, you're ready to start. Simply [run the file from your command line,](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Creating_Python_Programs) and the program will start. To start another round of vocab, re-run the program from the command line.
