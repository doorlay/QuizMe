## Description
Welcome to QuizMe! This is a small project, written in Python, that I'm turning in for my AP Computer Science Principles test. QuizMe intakes definitions and vocab terms from the user, and then quizzes them on those terms in a flashcard style, where the user can decide if they want to answer with terms, or definitions. It's user friendly and quite straightforward.
